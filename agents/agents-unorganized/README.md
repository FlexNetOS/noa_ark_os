### Agent Frameworks

[`Code By Agents`](https://github.com/baryhuang/code-by-agents) by
[Bary Huange](https://github.com/baryhuang) An orchestration framework for
designing and coordinating Claude Code agents, with a very clean interface, and
sophisticated orchestration logic. (I think this might possibly involve a
hand-rolled agent framework, given the committerdates, so that's pretty
amazing.)

[`awesome-claude-agents`](https://github.com/rahulvrane/awesome-claude-agents)
by [Rahul Rane](https://github.com/rahulvrane) A _slightly_ similar repository
😉 to the present one with a growing list of awesome agents for Claude Code.

[`Claude Code Subagents Collection`](https://github.com/wshobson/agents?tab=re)
by [Seth Hobson](https://github.com/wshobson). A pretty impressive resource with
_dozens_ of awesome-looking agents that I haven't even had time to explore yet,
but clearly this gentleman has put a lot of work into this feature that's been
out for one freaking day at the time of writing!
