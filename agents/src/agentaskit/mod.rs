//! Adapted AgentAsKit integration scaffolding.
//! 
//! This module hosts foundational types and protocols migrated from the
//! `agentaskit` CRC drop. The goal is to progressively merge the richer
//! AgentAsKit feature-set (execution engines, WASM host, etc.) while keeping
//! the NOA agents crate compiling cleanly.
