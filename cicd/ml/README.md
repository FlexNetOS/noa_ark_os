# ML CI Hooks

The assets in this directory extend the CI/CD stack with ML-specific guardrails.

- `drift_detection.yaml` schedules a nightly drift analysis that reads
  `registry/ml_artifacts.log` and `storage/db/evidence/ledger.jsonl`.
- `rollout_gate.yaml` executes on pushes to `main` to prevent deployments when
  drift is detected.
- Scripts under `scripts/` are offline utilities invoked by the workflows; they
  operate only on repository state to maintain the offline-first policy.
- Reports generated by these jobs are stored under `cicd/ml/reports/` and are
  uploaded as workflow artifacts for auditing.
