# NOA Unified Shell – XR Adapter

The XR adapter defines a spatial scene graph that positions persona-specific workspaces around the user. Each node maps to one of the unified shell personas so analysts can visualize telemetry and workflows in an immersive environment.

Renderers load `scene.graph.json` to determine what panels to instantiate and which real-time channels to subscribe to.
