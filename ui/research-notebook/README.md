# Research Notebook UI Package

The `@noa-ark/research-notebook` package consumes structured notebook exports generated by
research shells and renders consistent experiences across the web, desktop, and mobile
surfaces.  Notebook entries capture summaries, source citations, and media collections so
operators can review research outcomes without leaving the unified shell.

## Features

- Converts structured notebook payloads into the shared shell page schema.
- Responsive React components for web and desktop renderers.
- React Native friendly schema for mobile shells using the shared native renderer helpers.
- Aggregated citation registry with deep links back to the originating evidence.
- Media gallery support for images, video, audio, and file attachments.

## Usage

```ts
import { notebookToPageSchema } from "@noa-ark/research-notebook";
import { createWebRenderer } from "@noa-ark/shared-ui/renderers/web";
import { createResearchNotebookWebRegistry } from "@noa-ark/research-notebook/renderers/web";

const registry = {
  ...createResearchNotebookWebRegistry(),
};

const renderer = createWebRenderer({ registry });
const schema = notebookToPageSchema(notebook, { surface: "web" });

renderer.renderPage(schema, context);
```

See `ui/web/adaptive/research-notebook.tsx` for platform specific integration details.
