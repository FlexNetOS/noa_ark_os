# Gateway Operations Dashboard

This lightweight dashboard surfaces gateway latency, throughput, and agent activity metrics generated by the `noa_gateway`
crate. It reads the JSON metrics snapshot exported to `storage/telemetry/gateway_metrics.json` and renders quick visualisations
for on-call responders.

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve it from any static file server. The page auto-refreshes every 10 seconds to
provide near real-time feedback during incident response.
