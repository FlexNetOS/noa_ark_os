# Evidence Ledger

This directory stores append-only audit evidence generated by the workflow engine
and CI safety gates.

- `ledger.jsonl` — JSON Lines feed capturing genesis + immutable entries.
- Each entry contains:
  - `kind`: `genesis`, `stage_receipt`, or `security_scan`.
  - `timestamp`: milliseconds since epoch.
  - `reference`: Merkle root or signed operation reference.
  - `payload`: Structured metadata (stage metadata, Merkle levels, scan status, etc.).
  - `signed_operation`: Policy-enforced signature chain.

Ledger files are created automatically if missing. Do not edit by hand — always
use `PipelineInstrumentation` APIs so signatures stay valid.
