# Directory Organization Plan: Operational and Maintenance Overview
 
 This document outlines the organizational structure and planning for the
 workspace directory.
 
 ## Hierachy for Workspace Directory

 See /home/noa/dev/workspace/noa_ark_os/noa_ark_os/HIERARCHY.md for full details.
 
 ## Structure
 
 The workspace is organized into several key directories:
 
 - `apps/`: Contains application-specific code and resources.
 - `libs/`: Houses shared libraries and modules used across multiple applications.
 - `services/`: Includes backend services and APIs.
 - `tools/`: Contains utility scripts and tools for development and deployment.
 - `docs/`: Documentation related to the workspace and its components.
 
 ## Planning
 
 The planning for the workspace involves regular reviews and updates to ensure
 that the structure remains efficient and effective. Key considerations include:
 
 - **Scalability**: Ensuring that the directory structure can accommodate growth in
   applications, libraries, and services.
 - **Modularity**: Promoting modular design to facilitate easier maintenance and
   updates.
 - **Collaboration**: Structuring directories to support collaborative development
   efforts among team members.
 
 Regular audits of the directory organization will be conducted to identify areas
 for improvement and to implement necessary changes.
