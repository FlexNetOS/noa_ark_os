# Community Contribution Hub

This directory centralizes guidance for ecosystem partners extending Noa Ark OS. Use the documents below to understand contribution expectations, review workflows, and maintenance obligations.

- [`third-party-blueprints.md`](third-party-blueprints.md): Standards for proposing new workflow blueprints consumable by the UI catalog.
- [`marketplace-contributions.md`](marketplace-contributions.md): Requirements for listing applications and agents in the kernel marketplace.

## Maintainer Roles

Contributions to Noa Ark OS are reviewed by specialized catalog maintainers:

- **Blueprint Catalog Maintainers**: Review workflow blueprint submissions under `workflow/blueprints/`, verifying design, telemetry quality, and compliance posture.
- **Marketplace Catalog Maintainers**: Review marketplace listings under `apps/marketplace/catalog/`, executing functional evaluations and coordinating contract sign-offs.

Both maintainer teams follow documented review processes with defined SLAs and coordinate with the kernel security council for attestation requirements.

Future documents will cover localization, documentation best practices, and governance policies for emerging ecosystem tracks.
