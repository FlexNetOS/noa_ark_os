This directory centralizes guidance for ecosystem partners extending Noa Ark OS. Use the documents below to understand contribution expectations, review workflows, and maintenance obligations.

- [`third-party-blueprints.md`](third-party-blueprints.md): Standards for proposing new workflow blueprints consumable by the UI catalog.
