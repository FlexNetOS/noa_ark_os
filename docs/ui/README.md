# NOA ARK Design System & Experience Guidelines

The NOA ARK design system enables parity across the web, desktop (Tauri), mobile, and XR clients. Tokens, component blueprints, and interaction patterns live in `ui/shared/` and are rendered through the server-driven schema exposed by `server/ui_api/`.
