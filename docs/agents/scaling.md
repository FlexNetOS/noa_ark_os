# Scaling the Agent Hive

The Agent Hive Explorer exposes runtime controls for the hundreds of autonomous agents operating inside NOA ARK OS.

* **View load and health** metrics to understand which clusters need more capacity.
* **Scale or drain** individual agents or groups with a single action; confirmations route through the unified API gateway.
* **Automate policies** using workflow hooks so scaling decisions can be codified and replayed when similar conditions arise.
