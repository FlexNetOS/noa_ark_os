# AGENTOS-6 — Launch value-add ecosystem features

**Labels:** ecosystem, release, partner-program
**Priority:** P1
Depends on: AGENTOS-3, AGENTOS-4, AGENTOS-5

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ecosystem bundle artifact published with release notes, install instructions, and verification checklist.
- Community announcement drives adoption metrics (downloads, sign-ups) tracked via analytics dashboards.

## Checklist
- [ ] **Release packaging**
  - [ ] Curate blueprint bundles, marketplace items, and analytics datasets into a distributable artifact (zip/tarball) with checksum and manifest.
  - [ ] Draft release notes summarizing highlights, upgrade steps, and backward compatibility notes.
- [ ] **Documentation alignment**
  - [ ] Update `docs/workflows`, `docs/community`, and `docs/analytics` with feature spotlights, cross-links, and onboarding walkthroughs.
  - [ ] Produce `docs/releases/ecosystem_launch.md` playbook covering deliverables, upgrade paths, FAQs, and rollback guidance.
- [ ] **Community enablement**
  - [ ] Coordinate announcements across UI dashboard, release notes, Discord/Forum, and partner newsletters with clear CTAs.
  - [ ] Establish ecosystem contribution guidelines, reviewer rotation, triage board, and SLAs for incoming submissions.

## Scope
**Objective:** Launch a cohesive ecosystem release bundling blueprints, marketplace assets, and analytics resources with clear community pathways.

**Success criteria:**
- Ecosystem bundle artifact published with release notes, install instructions, and verification checklist.
- Community announcement drives adoption metrics (downloads, sign-ups) tracked via analytics dashboards.

**Dependencies:** Completion of tasks 1–6, coordination with marketing/comms, publication infrastructure for release bundles.

**Risks & mitigation:** Launch alignment may slip due to upstream blockers → maintain dependency tracker and contingency date; community guidelines adoption risk → run office hours/webinars post-launch.

## Coordination Notes
- Engage ecosystem/partner program leads to plan deliverables and success metrics.
- Coordinate with docs owners to update roadmap links referencing this effort so they now point to this issue.
