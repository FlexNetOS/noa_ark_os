# Incident Response with Workflow Overrides

Operations teams can remediate incidents directly from the unified shell without leaving the console.

1. Navigate to the **Workflow Command Center** and locate the impacted pipeline run.
2. Use the override controls to pause, resume, or reroute execution. Overrides are audited and broadcast over the unified event bus.
3. Coordinate with developers via the AI Ops Studio chat, which keeps the discussion linked to the workflow timeline and artifacts.

The incident response toolkit works consistently across desktop, mobile, and XR adapters because they share the same orchestration APIs.
