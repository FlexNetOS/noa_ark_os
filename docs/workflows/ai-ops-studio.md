# AI Ops Studio Workflow Guide

The AI Ops Studio chat workspace allows developers to execute pipelines, inspect logs, and review diffs without leaving the conversation.

1. Open the **AI Ops Studio** workspace from the navigation rail or by asking the copilot to "open chat".
2. Use commands like `run build` or `deploy staging` to trigger workflows that are defined in the unified catalog.
3. Monitor streaming status updates that appear inline with the conversation. When a run finishes, the studio surfaces the resulting artifacts and metrics for quick follow-up.

The unified FastAPI gateway powers these actions, so the same conversational workflows remain available across web, desktop, and mobile adapters.
