# Storage Governance Checklist

Storage & Artifact Hub enforces retention and compliance policies across repositories and generated assets.

1. Review the default retention policies applied per workspace persona.
2. Configure exceptions for regulated data sets and ensure export logs are enabled.
3. Monitor audit trails to verify that artifact lifecycle events match your governance requirements.
4. Require evidence ledger entries for all notebook-derived insights, linking the analytics materialization ID, governing pipeline run, and reviewer sign-off to maintain traceable provenance.
