# Storage Governance Checklist

Storage & Artifact Hub enforces retention and compliance policies across repositories and generated assets.

1. Review the default retention policies applied per workspace persona.
2. Configure exceptions for regulated data sets and ensure export logs are enabled.
3. Monitor audit trails to verify that artifact lifecycle events match your governance requirements.
