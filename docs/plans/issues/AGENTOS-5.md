# AGENTOS-5 — Develop advanced gateway with observability

## Context
- Source: `docs/plans/gap_remediation_tasks.md` (requirements captured from lines 211-331).
- Objective: Deliver an advanced, policy-aware gateway with first-class observability so platform teams can trace, audit, and optimize end-to-end traffic flows.
- Outcome: Harden the gateway runtime, expose actionable telemetry, and unblock downstream automation consumers aligned with AGENTOS-2 dependencies.

## Detailed Checklist
### Architecture & Control Plane
- [ ] Finalize multi-tenant gateway topology with ingress, egress, and policy enforcement layers.
- [ ] Implement intent validation pipeline that leverages schema contracts established by AGENTOS-2.
- [ ] Extend routing engine to support dynamic path optimization, failover triggers, and safety interlocks.
- [ ] Provide configuration surfaces for per-tenant limits, quota enforcement, and adaptive throttling.

### Networking Integration
- [ ] Align with the Networking Team on supported protocols, transport security posture, and segmentation requirements.
- [ ] Document northbound/southbound API contracts, including health checks and lifecycle hooks for service onboarding.
- [ ] Validate gateway interoperability with existing service meshes and load balancers (blue/green, canary, and rollback scenarios).
- [ ] Establish automated network policy conformance tests covering ingress filtering, egress restrictions, and zero-trust posture.

### Observability & Instrumentation
- [ ] Partner with the Observability Team to define metrics, logs, and traces required for production readiness.
- [ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry exporters for request spans, policy evaluation traces, and dependency fan-out tracking.
- [ ] Emit RED (Rate, Errors, Duration) and USE (Utilization, Saturation, Errors) metrics with SLO annotations for critical gateway paths.
- [ ] Wire structured logging with correlation IDs to support cross-service investigations and automated incident response.
- [ ] Produce Grafana/Chronograf dashboards, alert rules, and runbook links for on-call rotations.

### Quality, Security, and Automation
- [ ] Build integration tests that simulate multi-tenant workloads, failure injection, and observability signal verification.
- [ ] Add security scans for policy bypass attempts, malformed intent payloads, and transport downgrade attacks.
- [ ] Ensure CI enforces linting, security, and regression suites for gateway modules and observability pipelines.
- [ ] Provide staged rollout plan (dev → staging → production) with feature flags and rollback automation.

### Documentation & Enablement
- [ ] Publish architecture overview, deployment guide, and operator handbook covering instrumentation expectations.
- [ ] Document onboarding checklist for service owners, including telemetry hooks and validation steps.
- [ ] Coordinate changelog updates with roadmap maintainers and distribute enablement materials to partner teams.
- [ ] Capture lessons learned and feed them back into the gateway roadmap and observability standards.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Gateway routes intents end-to-end with policy enforcement, passing automated integration and security tests.
2. Observability stack exposes actionable metrics, logs, and traces validated by the Observability Team with agreed SLO coverage.
3. Networking Team signs off on protocol support, segmentation, and rollout plan with documented playbooks.
4. Dashboards, alerts, and runbooks are published and linked from operator documentation.
5. Roadmap maintainers receive the live issue URL for linkage and status tracking.

## Collaborators & Alignment
- **Networking Team** — Co-own protocol validation, segmentation policies, and rollout playbooks.
- **Observability Team** — Define instrumentation expectations, validate telemetry coverage, and steward dashboards/alerts.
- **Gateway Core Maintainers** — Implement runtime changes, integrate instrumentation, and manage deployment automation.

### Instrumentation Expectations
- Provide end-to-end tracing coverage for ingress handshake → policy evaluation → backend dispatch.
- Emit per-tenant quota metrics, saturation signals, and error budgets suitable for automated alerting.
- Store observability configurations (dashboards, alerts) under version control with review gates from Observability Team.

## Meta
- **Priority:** P1
- **Depends on:** AGENTOS-2
- **Issue URL:** https://github.com/noa-ark/noa_ark_os/issues/AGENTOS-5 *(share with roadmap maintainers for canonical linkage)*
- **Collaborators:** Networking Team, Observability Team

## Roadmap Coordination
- Notify roadmap maintainers once the GitHub issue is live so they can update cross-references in planning artifacts.
- Track alignment updates in the roadmap status meeting notes and mirror any scope adjustments back into this issue.
