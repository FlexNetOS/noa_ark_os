# Gap Remediation Tasks for the PM Roadmap

The following remediation items align to the roadmap themes and ensure prerequisite guardrails are in place before feature execution. Each remediation thread links directly to the detailed task entry defined in the roadmap.

## Kernel-first dependency graph & portable packaging
- **Intent:** Close validation and packaging gaps before kernels ship portable bundles.
- **Remediation focus:** Harden dependency capture, manifest validation, and offline bundle verification.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-kernel-graph)

## Single-host server profile (full stack on one machine)
- **Intent:** Remove deployment friction for lab and demo environments.
- **Remediation focus:** Script repeatable provisioning and observability coverage to surface regressions.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-single-host)

## Unified UI/UX shell (desktop + web + immersive)
- **Intent:** Prevent divergence between shell experiences across canvases.
- **Remediation focus:** Establish shared shell patterns, documentation, and feature flag pathways.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-unified-shell)

## Adaptive runtime/portability (edge/VM/containers)
- **Intent:** Ensure runtime policies adapt safely across heterogeneous targets.
- **Remediation focus:** Build confidence with environment detection, policy authoring, and telemetry validation.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-adaptive-runtime)

## Advanced gateway & observability (routing, security, metrics)
- **Intent:** Mitigate routing and security drift while expanding observability guardrails.
- **Remediation focus:** Codify policy tooling, authentication adapters, and golden-signal dashboards.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-gateway-observability)

## Value-add ecosystem (blueprints, automation, analytics)
- **Intent:** Guarantee marketplace assets deliver measurable value and stay operable.
- **Remediation focus:** Curate blueprints, automate analytics packs, and launch guided onboarding.
- **Suggested task:** [View task](#task-ecosystem-value)
