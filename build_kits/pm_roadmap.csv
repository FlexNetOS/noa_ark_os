AGENTOS-1,Establish kernel dependency graph & portable packaging,Kernel-first dependency graph & portable packaging,"Build a unified dependency graph for kernels covering runtime crates, models, and system services, then emit portable bundles compatible with OCI registries and air-gapped installs.",P0,Proposed,,Graph validation command fails on missing or cyclic dependencies.|;Portable bundle installs succeed on a clean machine using documented steps.
AGENTOS-2,Design single-host AgentOS server profile,Single-host server profile (full stack on one machine),"Deliver a reference deployment profile that layers gateway, runtime services, storage, and UI on a single host with scripted bootstrap and health diagnostics.",P0,Proposed,AGENTOS-1,Bootstrap script completes on a clean VM using documented prerequisites.|;Health dashboard reports green status for all core services under nominal load.
AGENTOS-3,Deliver unified UI/UX shell,Unified UI/UX shell (desktop + web + immersive),"Create a shared shell framework that synchronizes navigation, session state, and notifications across desktop, web, and immersive canvases with adaptive layouts.",P1,Proposed,AGENTOS-2,Shell components render consistently across target surfaces using design tokens.|;Feature flag toggles immersive canvas bridge without regressions in existing clients.
AGENTOS-4,Implement adaptive runtime portability policies,Adaptive runtime/portability (edge/VM/containers),"Extend runtime scheduler to detect edge, VM, and container contexts, applying tuned placement, resource quotas, and failover behaviors.",P1,Proposed,AGENTOS-2,Runtime enforces context-appropriate policies verified by automated smoke tests.|;Observability dashboards surface policy decisions and outcomes per workload.
AGENTOS-5,Advance gateway security & observability mesh,"Advanced gateway & observability (routing, security, metrics)","Harden gateway with policy-driven routing, zero-trust authentication adapters, and end-to-end observability spanning traces, metrics, and alerts.",P1,Proposed,AGENTOS-4,Security posture meets defined zero-trust baseline validated by penetration tests.|;Observability dashboards and alerts cover golden signals with actionable metadata.
