AGENTOS-0,Activate Agentic PM governance program,Program kickoff & evidence ledger,"Stand up the Agentic PM program with a published evidence ledger so planners, shells, and automation kits consume the same AGENTOS-0..10 definitions.",P0,Completed,,"Roadmap docs enumerate AGENTOS-0..10 with links to implementation evidence.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: docs/roadmaps/agentic_pm_unification.md and build_kits/pm_roadmap.* now act as the shared ledger for automation, planners, and governance."
AGENTOS-1,Establish kernel dependency graph & portable packaging,Kernel-first dependency graph & portable packaging,"Build a unified dependency graph for kernels covering runtime crates, models, and system services, then emit portable bundles compatible with OCI registries and air-gapped installs.",P0,Completed,,Graph validation command fails on missing or cyclic dependencies.|;Portable bundle installs succeed on a clean machine using documented steps.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: runtime/kernel/graph.yaml plus cargo run -p runtime_manager --bin validate_kernel_graph and tools/portable_builder.py document the dependency graph + portable bundle flow.
AGENTOS-2,Design single-host AgentOS server profile,Single-host server profile (full stack on one machine),"Deliver a reference deployment profile that layers gateway, runtime services, storage, and UI on a single host with scripted bootstrap and health diagnostics.",P0,Completed,AGENTOS-1,Bootstrap script completes on a clean VM using documented prerequisites.|;Health dashboard reports green status for all core services under nominal load.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: services/single-host/init/noa-single-host.sh with docs/deployments/single_host.md covers bootstrap + health verification on one host.
AGENTOS-3,Deliver unified UI/UX shell,Unified UI/UX shell (desktop + web + immersive),"Create a shared shell framework that synchronizes navigation, session state, and notifications across desktop, web, and immersive canvases with adaptive layouts.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-2,Shell components render consistently across target surfaces using design tokens.|;Feature flag toggles immersive canvas bridge without regressions in existing clients.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: ui/core/src/module.rs and scripts/dev/full_system_launch.sh hydrate shared shell navigation across desktop/web/immersive surfaces.
AGENTOS-4,Implement adaptive runtime portability policies,Adaptive runtime/portability (edge/VM/containers),"Extend runtime scheduler to detect edge, VM, and container contexts, applying tuned placement, resource quotas, and failover behaviors.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-2,Runtime enforces context-appropriate policies verified by automated smoke tests.|;Observability dashboards surface policy decisions and outcomes per workload.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: runtime/manager/src/lib.rs (AdaptiveRuntimeController) + server/src/adaptive_scaling.rs enforce context-aware policies with telemetry-backed smoke tests.
AGENTOS-5,Advance gateway security & observability mesh,"Advanced gateway & observability (routing, security, metrics)","Harden gateway with policy-driven routing, zero-trust authentication adapters, and end-to-end observability spanning traces, metrics, and alerts.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-4,"Security posture meets defined zero-trust baseline validated by penetration tests.|;Observability dashboards and alerts cover golden signals with actionable metadata.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: server/gateway/src/{auth,policy,telemetry}.rs implements zero-trust adapters, routing policy compiler, and end-to-end telemetry exported under storage/telemetry."
AGENTOS-6,Launch value-add automation & analytics kits,"Value-add ecosystem (blueprints, automation, analytics)","Publish curated blueprints, automation packs, and analytics accelerators with pipelines, sample data, and guided onboarding inside the marketplace.",P2,Completed,AGENTOS-5,Marketplace lists ≥3 automation/analytics packs with verified install flows.|;Guided onboarding results in successful trial run captured by telemetry events.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: services/marketplace and apps/marketplace/catalog ship the automation/analytics packs with verified onboarding flows.
AGENTOS-7,Rejoin dashboard and Kanban via Agentic PM shell,Unified Agentic UI,"Embed the Vibe Kanban workspace, planner memory, CRC upload tools, and workflow launchers inside the shared ui/core shell while retiring the static dashboard.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-3,"A single navigation model renders Kanban analytics, planner memory, CRC uploads, and workflow tiles inside ui/core across desktop/web/mobile/XR.|;Legacy ui/noa-dashboard entry points are removed or redirect to the Agentic shell without functionality loss.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: ui/core (Lazy shell modules) + ui/vibe-kanban embed Kanban analytics, planner memory, CRC uploads, and workflow tiles inside the unified shell."
AGENTOS-8,Ship cross-platform interactive Agentic UI packages,Cross-platform interactive UX,"Package the unified shell for desktop (Tauri), mobile (Expo), and XR with interactive widgets (workflow launchers, agent critique feeds, drag-drop CRC drops) calling the unified API contract.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-7,"Desktop, mobile, and XR builds share the same navigation metadata and interactive widgets.|;Feature-flag toggles enable/disable immersive canvases without regressions in other clients.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: ui/shared schema + apps/desktop-shell, apps/mobile-shell, and apps/xr-shell consume the same metadata to package the Agentic UI for every surface."
AGENTOS-9,Map Agent Factory hierarchy into project management flows,Agentic PM governance,Align Vibe Kanban personas and escalations with the L1–L5 Agent Factory layers so workflows auto-escalate and report health using the constitutional hierarchy.,P1,Completed,AGENTOS-8,"Kanban roles expose L1–L5 escalation paths and health indicators inside the shell.|;Agent Factory telemetry (hive mind, swarm, disposable agents) is visible in the shared dashboard.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: ui/vibe-kanban/app/components/AgentFactoryPanel.tsx maps L1–L5 personas from agents/README.md into the workspace so escalations are visible inside the shell."
AGENTOS-10,General-availability goal insights and autonomy,Agentic autonomy rollout,"Complete the Kanban goal insights/autonomy rollout (shadow → preview → pilot → GA) with telemetry freshness, autonomous retry, and escalation safeguards documented.",P1,Completed,AGENTOS-9,"Goal KPI freshness < 2 minutes, <5% false-positive autonomous retries, and 100% escalations logged in the workspace event stream.|;Documented kill switches (feature flags + capability registry) disable the features without migrations.|;ACCEPTANCE NOTE: docs/plans/kanban_goal_insights_rollout.md, registry/capabilities.json, and ui/vibe-kanban feature flags document GA goal insights/autonomy with kill switches."
