# Research Paper: Gateway Integration and Policy

**Generated By:** Noa Ark OS Research Agent (Simulated)
**Generation Time:** 2025-11-18T16:31:57.129404
**Source Context:** We need a formal report on how to ensure all notebook-initiated tasks are policy-compliant via the Gateway....

## 1. Abstract
This paper summarizes the key findings related to the topic "Gateway Integration and Policy", derived from a deep, structured analysis of the Noa Ark OS codebase and its core architectural components. The analysis focused on identifying integration points and adherence to the Universal Task Execution Policy.

## 2. Methodology (Agentic Analysis)
The research was conducted by a specialized Agent Swarm, orchestrated by the MicroAgentStack. The process involved:
1.  **Symbol Indexing:** Full-depth search across all repository files and symbols.
2.  **Policy Cross-Check:** Verification against the Universal Task Execution Policy.
3.  **Synthesis:** Formatting raw findings into a structured, human-readable document.

## 3. Key Findings and Architectural Mapping
The following points represent the most critical findings for the given topic:

### Gateway Integration
> The Noa Ark OS Gateway (noa_kernel) is the mandatory policy enforcement point. Integration requires symbol registration (e.g., 'pm.task.execute') and adherence to the Universal Task Execution Policy.

### Unified Server API
> The Unified Server (Python/Rust) provides the single API endpoint for all services. Notebook integration should target this API for stability and security.

### Documentation Structure
> The repository utilizes a structured documentation approach, with separate components for Wiki, Run-book, and Research output, emphasizing Markdown as the standard format.


## 4. Relevant Code Symbols and Files
The following symbols were identified as central to the research topic:

| File Path | Component | Language |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| core/src/gateway.rs | gateway.rs | Rust |
| repos/MicroAgentStack/orchestrator.py | orchestrator.py | Python |
| repos/agentaskit/agentaskit-production/core/src/task.rs | agentaskit-production | Rust |
| server/python/infrastructure/unified_api_gateway.py | infrastructure | Python |

## 5. Conclusion
The analysis confirms that the integration of features related to "{data['topic']}" must be routed through the Gateway and utilize the Unified Server API for stable, policy-compliant operation.
