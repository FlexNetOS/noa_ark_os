# Ecosystem bundle

The ecosystem bundle coordinates value-add services layered on top of the kernel manifest, unified UI shell, adaptive runtime,
and policy gateway. Use `create_default_bundle` from `services.marketplace.ecosystem_bundle` to validate dependencies and enable
feature toggles guarded by licensing and readiness signals.
