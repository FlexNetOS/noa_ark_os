# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `docs/guides/AGENTIC_OS_GUIDE.md` outlining operator workflows, policy
  enforcement, and CLI-first execution patterns.
- Kernel sovereignty and tokenized gateway diagrams under `.graphs/workflows/`
  with embedded copies in the new guide.
- Repository-wide markdown linting via `pnpm docs:lint` and `make docs:check`.

### Updated

- `AGENT.md` cross-links to the new guide and codifies Phase 0.5–10 patterns
  (snapshots, capability tokens, registry-only execution).
- `docs/guides/README.md` index now references the Agentic OS Operator Guide.
