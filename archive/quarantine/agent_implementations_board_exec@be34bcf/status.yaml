  - Agent Framework Team
reason: "Inactive board/executive agent implementations produced >30 warnings during `cargo test -p noa_agents -p noa_core -p noa_workflow`."
reintegration_criteria:
  - Add feature flags or runtime wiring so these agents are exercised by tests
  - Achieve warning-free builds (treat warnings as errors locally)
  - Document new interfaces in docs/projects/ROADMAP_AGENTIC_KERNEL.md
