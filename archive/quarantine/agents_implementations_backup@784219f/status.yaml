owners:
  - Agent Platform Team
reason: "Legacy board/executive agent code was generating unused warnings and is not wired into the runtime."
reintegration_criteria:
  - Reactivate only when lifecycle plan and tests exist
  - Ensure `cargo test -p noa_agents` passes with warnings treated as errors
  - Update roadmap + README when restored
