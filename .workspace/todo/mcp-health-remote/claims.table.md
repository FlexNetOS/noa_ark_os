# Claims Table — Fork MCP Health Guard

| ID | Claim | Evidence | Verification | Limits |
|----|-------|----------|--------------|--------|
| C1 | `cicd/scripts/codex-mcp-health.sh` now supports remote-only targets, external `python` fallbacks, and first-class tool validation before exercising the MCP bridge. | File hash `a9c88daaed15c520e5a4d33abe2081ba389da5e3d39e22fdfa8a6759e491e192`. | `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" cicd/scripts/codex-mcp-health.sh` (local mode) and the remote-only run logged in `logs/codex-mcp-health/{local,remote}.log`. | Health check still expects a reachable HTTP endpoint and JSON-RPC-capable MCP server; it will fail on air-gapped systems without an agent stub. |
| C2 | `scripts/codex-bootstrap.sh` auto-detects the available Python interpreter on Linux/macOS/Windows shells before patching `~/.codex/config.toml`. | File hash `2c402e35c23a06cc2feafff26fc71562d9a44609fee0a402915d51e2aff3f807`. | `scripts/codex-bootstrap.sh` exited 0 after reinstalling Codex CLI + `noa-mcp-server` (see command log in `evidence.ledger.json`). | Still assumes `curl`/`tar` availability; Windows users must launch it from Git Bash or WSL for POSIX tooling. |
| C3 | Fork-only GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/noa-mcp-health.yml` runs Codex bootstrap + MCP health checks on `ubuntu`, `macos`, and `windows` for PRs originating from forks. | File hash `399ca575f7e22d07c526061e4fd71516cf6bd8aeb2badd64c06a863c8677193b`. | Workflow definition includes matrix, remote agent bootstrap, and guard condition `if: github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == true` (see file). | Not yet observed on CI; success depends on Codex release availability for each runner OS. |
| C4 | `docs/guides/dev-environment-cli.md` now documents macOS/Windows bootstrap tips, remote `NOA_TOOLS_SERVER_URL` usage, and the new fork guard. | File hash `fc9e2f518c6d0f9ad25ac068a5c8fbf11521306d9dbcecf26d85e2e2c2393149`. | Manual review of the rendered markdown plus linkage cited in this table. | Guide additions describe baseline workflows but do not replace platform-specific READMEs; future edits may be needed as tooling evolves. |
| C5 | Remote-only MCP guard scenario is validated end-to-end using background `noa_tools_agent` plus remote env vars. | Log hashes: `logs/codex-mcp-health/local.log` = `5ea80c5a199e1db36d37b1e03069adb574aa0132e6be6c8cbf8889c23eadcd58`, `logs/codex-mcp-health/remote.log` = `4bca87059e6294397f0e0f1dab947079eefcdb3447393e6f7cad75e9460efef6`. | Commands recorded in `evidence.ledger.json` (local + remote). | Remote validation was performed against `http://127.0.0.1:8910/`; true remote gateways may introduce TLS or auth requirements not covered here. |
