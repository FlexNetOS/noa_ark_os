# CLAUDE Provider Instructions

- **Interface preference:** Use the CLI-based provider workflow whenever possible. Only fall back to IDE extensions when the CLI cannot satisfy the request and record the reason.
- **Policy source:** No additional instructions live here; follow `AGENT.md` (as referenced by `.github/AGENT_POINTER.txt`) for all operational rules.
