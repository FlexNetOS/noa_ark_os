## CRC/CI/CD Pipeline 🔥

### Complete Automation Flow

```
External Code → CRC Drop-In → AI Analysis → Auto-Adapt -->
  → Archive Original → CI Validation → CD Deploy -->
  → Production (Zero Human Touch)
```

### Key Features

#### CRC - Continuous ReCode
- 📂 **Drop-in folder**: Just drop code, system handles rest
- 🤖 **AI supervision**: Understands and adapts code
- ✅ **Auto-approve**: 95% confidence → automatic deployment
- 🗜️ **Auto-archive**: Compress originals, no stale code
- 📊 **Cross-reference**: Fast lookups without extraction
- 🔄 **Full automation**: Zero human intervention

#### Enhanced CI/CD
- 🎯 **CRC integration**: Triggered by adapted code
- 🤖 **AI confidence**: Auto-approve based on confidence
- ⚡ **< 15 min**: Commit to production
- 🔵 **Blue-Green**: Zero-downtime staging
- 🕯️ **Canary**: Gradual production rollout
- 🔄 **Auto-rollback**: < 30 seconds on failure

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the workspace
cargo build --release

# Run CRC/CI/CD demo
cargo run --example crc_cicd_demo

# Run full system demo
cargo run --example full_system_demo

# Run the kernel
cargo run --bin noa_kernel

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace
```

See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed instructions.
