  - id: relocation-guardrails
    title: "Relocation Guardrail Compliance"
    description: "Tracks execution quality of storage relocation automation"
    queries:
      - metric: relocation.execution.success_rate
        statistic: avg
        window: 24h
        unit: ratio
        notes: "Higher is better; measures successful batch transfers over total"
      - metric: relocation.validation.checksum_mismatch
        statistic: sum
        window: 24h
        unit: count
        notes: "Rolling sum of checksum mismatches discovered during validation"
    thresholds:
      success_rate:
        warning: 0.97
        critical: 0.95
        unit: ratio
        rationale: "Below 95% indicates relocation guardrails failing consistently"
      checksum_mismatch:
        warning: 1
        critical: 3
        unit: count
        rationale: "Any mismatch requires follow-up; three indicates systemic drift"

  - id: documentation-recovery
    title: "Documentation Recovery Throughput"
    description: "Monitors documentation regeneration speed and quality"
    queries:
      - metric: docs.regeneration.runtime_minutes
        statistic: p95
        window: 7d
        unit: minutes
        notes: "Time for automation to regenerate authoritative documentation"
      - metric: docs.validation.review_latency_minutes
        statistic: p75
        window: 7d
        unit: minutes
        notes: "Measures stakeholder review cycle time for regenerated docs"
      - metric: docs.incident.ttd_minutes
        statistic: avg
        window: 7d
        unit: minutes
        notes: "Mean time to detect documentation regressions from telemetry"
    thresholds:
      runtime_minutes:
        warning: 30
        critical: 45
        unit: minutes
        rationale: "Regeneration past 45 minutes risks breaching recovery targets"
      review_latency_minutes:
        warning: 60
        critical: 90
        unit: minutes
        rationale: "Reviews beyond 90 minutes create outage risk for dependent teams"
      ttd_minutes:
        warning: 20
        critical: 30
        unit: minutes
        rationale: "Detection lag over 30 minutes degrades response readiness"

  - id: automation-roi
    title: "Automation ROI Snapshot"
    description: "Compares automation investment to realized savings"
    queries:
      - metric: automation.roi.hours_saved
        statistic: sum
        window: 30d
        unit: hours
        notes: "Engineering hours avoided through automation-assisted recovery"
      - metric: automation.roi.cost_avoidance_usd
        statistic: sum
        window: 30d
        unit: usd
        notes: "Financial impact of automated relocations and doc recovery"
      - metric: automation.roi.incidents_avoided
        statistic: sum
        window: 30d
        unit: count
        notes: "Simulated incidents avoided via proactive automation guardrails"
    thresholds:
      hours_saved:
        warning: 120
        critical: 80
        unit: hours
        rationale: "Below 80 hours saved indicates diminishing automation returns"
      cost_avoidance_usd:
        warning: 25000
        critical: 15000
        unit: usd
        rationale: "Falling under $15k suggests automation cost exceeds benefit"
      incidents_avoided:
        warning: 5
        critical: 2
        unit: count
        rationale: "Less than two avoided incidents signals guardrail coverage gaps"
