# Audit Artifacts

This directory stores offline reproducibility evidence generated by `make pipeline.local`.

* `SBOM.kernel.cdx.json` / `SBOM.extensions.cdx.json` – CycloneDX inventories for the kernel and extension crates.
* `artifacts.manifest.json` – Deterministic manifest of packaged tarballs and SBOM digests.
* `signatures.json` and `*.sig` – HMAC-based signatures produced by the offline signing shim.
* `bundles/` – Published audit bundles sealed after verification.
* `ledger.jsonl` – Append-only ledger capturing bundle hashes, trust scores, and snapshot IDs.
* `offline-dev-hmac.key` – Deterministic development key used for local signing. Replace in production.

## Local Pipeline Status Evidence
This directory stores machine-generated artifacts that prove the local pipeline executed before any branch is pushed or merged. Every run of `make pipeline.local` refreshes the evidence manifest written to `local_pipeline_status.json`, which is then validated both by git hooks and the GitHub workflows.

Do not edit these files manually. Always re-run the local pipeline to update the evidence.
