# Audit Artifacts

This directory houses autonomous release evidence produced by the CI/CD stack.

## Layout

- `ledger.jsonl` – append-only ledger that records auto-approvals, rollback drills, and other
  safety-critical events.
- `bundle-*` – signed audit bundles emitted by `cargo run --manifest-path cicd/Cargo.toml --bin publish_audit`.
- `merges/` – git merge previews created by trusted auto-merges.
- `rollbacks/` – rollback simulation results generated by the scheduled drills.
- `verify.py` / `verify.sh` – reproducible verification scripts for audit bundles.

The `publish_audit` tool regenerates the verification helpers on each run to guarantee that
local and CI workflows use the same validation logic. Generated bundle content is ignored by
Git so the repository only tracks reproducible scripts, the ledger, and structural metadata.
