# Audit Artifacts

This directory houses autonomous release evidence produced by the CI/CD stack.

## Layout

- `ledger.jsonl` – append-only ledger that records auto-approvals, rollback drills, and other
  safety-critical events.
- `bundle-*` – signed audit bundles (planned: will be emitted by a future `publish_audit` tool).
- `merges/` – git merge previews created by trusted auto-merges.
- `rollbacks/` – rollback simulation results generated by the scheduled drills.
- `verify.py` / `verify.sh` – reproducible verification scripts for audit bundles.

_Note: The `publish_audit` tool referenced above is not yet implemented. Once available, it will regenerate the verification helpers on each run to guarantee that local and CI workflows use the same validation logic._
Generated bundle content is ignored by Git so the repository only tracks reproducible scripts, the ledger, and structural metadata.
# Audit Artifacts

This directory stores offline reproducibility evidence generated by `make pipeline.local`.

* `SBOM.kernel.cdx.json` / `SBOM.extensions.cdx.json` – CycloneDX inventories for the kernel and extension crates.
* `artifacts.manifest.json` – Deterministic manifest of packaged tarballs and SBOM digests.
* `signatures.json` and `*.sig` – HMAC-based signatures produced by the offline signing shim.
* `bundles/` – Published audit bundles sealed after verification.
* `ledger.jsonl` – Append-only ledger capturing bundle hashes, trust scores, and snapshot IDs.
* `offline-dev-hmac.key` – Deterministic development key used for local signing. Replace in production.

## Local Pipeline Status Evidence
This directory stores machine-generated artifacts that prove the local pipeline executed before any branch is pushed or merged. Every run of `make pipeline.local` refreshes the evidence manifest written to `local_pipeline_status.json`, which is then validated both by git hooks and the GitHub workflows.

Do not edit these files manually. Always re-run the local pipeline to update the evidence.
