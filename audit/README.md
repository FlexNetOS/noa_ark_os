# Audit Artifacts

This directory houses autonomous release evidence produced by the CI/CD stack.

## Layout

- `ledger.jsonl` – append-only ledger that records auto-approvals, rollback drills, and other
  safety-critical events.
- `bundle-*` – signed audit bundles (planned: will be emitted by a future `publish_audit` tool).
- `merges/` – git merge previews created by trusted auto-merges.
- `rollbacks/` – rollback simulation results generated by the scheduled drills.
- `verify.py` / `verify.sh` – reproducible verification scripts for audit bundles.

_Note: The `publish_audit` tool referenced above is not yet implemented. Once available, it will regenerate the verification helpers on each run to guarantee that local and CI workflows use the same validation logic._
Generated bundle content is ignored by Git so the repository only tracks reproducible scripts, the ledger, and structural metadata.
